    </h1>
    <section id="description" style="color: black; font-style: italic">
        <p style="font-size: x-large;"> In the world of Macro Markets, navigating through a plethora of noise is a daunting challenge. The key lies in effectively reducing this noise to uncover valuable signals. To address this fundamental issue, ingenious Macro Strategists have devised various filters to identify these signals amidst the overwhelming sea of information. Among these filters, the FX Filter stands out as a powerful tool that Portfolio Managers can rely on to make well-informed decisions on when to buy or sell. However, the human element of judgment introduces its own layer of noise, potentially hindering optimal outcomes.
        <br> <br>
        To combat this, the process of judgment can be systematically structured, leading to a substantial reduction in noise and a remarkable improvement in decision quality.With the help of others, I have sought to transform this filter into a systematic trading algorithm with the ultimate goal of uncovering alpha in the market. By embracing a disciplined and data-driven approach, I aim to enhance the ability to discern valuable signals, and refine the trading strategy to achieve more consistent success in the ever-changing world of Global Macro </p>

        Currency Scoring
    </h2>
    <section id="description">
        <p> Currency pairs are scored based on 3 variables (<span class="highlight-green">var_1</span>, <span class="highlight-cyan">var_2</span>, <span class="highlight-magenta">var_3</span>). 
            These variables, signals, indicators, components, whatever you want to call them, change with time and are assinged a score of their own.
            The final <span class="highlight-yellow">score</span> for each currency pair is a composite of these three variables

        <p> Here is <span class="highlight-magenta">var_3</span> 
            as a Cross-Matrix between currency pairs. I get the data for each currency 
            then construct the crosses between the currency to create a currency pair

        Finding Signals
    </h2>
    <section id="description">
        <p> I took the <span class="highlight-yellow">score</span> for a couple currency pairs and plotted them over time.
        We can then apply some arbitrary threshold. With a threshold as a filter we can start to devise strategies.
        For example. If the score for a currency pair is above 200, long the pair and hold it till it drops below 200. 
        If the score is below -200, short the pair until it goes back above -200.  </p>

        <p>I backtested the trading algorithm on two strategies. Over a 10 year period, with a couple different currency pairs</p>
        <p><b>Classic Strategy</b>: Long and hold when score is above a threshold. Short and hold when score is below a threshold <br>

        Sharpe Ratios and Avg. Yearly Returns</h3>

        <p>Here is a look at the Sharpe Ratios and Avg for the Mean Reversion Strategy. 
            You can see that this strategy produces very high alphas for certain currency pairs given specific score thresholds. 
            A Sharpe Ratio of 1 for those pairs is also very good. Whether this signal holds up in the future is to be seen...</p>

        The backtesting process provided me with valuable insights into the algorithm's effectiveness under different market conditions with various currency pairs. Through this hands-on evaluation, I was able to make informed decisions about the algorithm's performance and potential for generating alpha in the market.
